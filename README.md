# reMarkable

Customizations for reMarkable and reMarkable 2 Paper Tablet.
Scripts tested and working on version `2.0.x`, `2.1.x`, `2.11.x` and `3.4.x`

## Automatically change your poweroff and suspend screens every 5 minutes

Starting with version `2.11.x` and above (`3.x` included), ReMarkable loads screen images during the startup only, so it does not hot load from the filesystem anymore: you need to restart the device to see the new randomly selected image. This means even the suspended image cannot be changed on the fly anymore, and you can see the new image only after a restart.

I will explore the possibility of reloading the interface in memory. I already found how to reload the entire UI, but I will apply this feature only if I can find a way to do it during the device's sleep time rather than when the user is actively using it.

### Manual installation

- Connect to your reMarkable via ssh and copy this repo into a temp folder (i.e., `/home/root/temp/reMarkable-customizations`)

- Create dedicated folders for your scripts and images

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/share/remarkable/scripts
mkdir -p /home/root/customization/images/poweroff
mkdir -p /home/root/customization/images/suspended
```

- Copy the script into the correct folder and set it executable

```bash
cp /home/root/temp/reMarkable-customizations/scripts/random-screens/set-random-screens.sh /usr/share/remarkable/scripts/
chmod +x /usr/share/remarkable/scripts/set-random-screens.sh
```

- Copy some images under dedicated folders

```bash
cp /home/root/temp/reMarkable-customizations/images/poweroff/* /home/root/customization/images/poweroff
cp /home/root/temp/reMarkable-customizations/images/suspended/* /home/root/customization/images/suspended
```

Name of the files is not important: every image in the folder will be eligible to be selected randomly by the script. You can find very good example in this repo.
_Note: I found them on Facebook but I can't find the author anymore, I'm sorry. If you find them, please send a PR to this repo._

- Copy service and timer in the correct folder

```bash
cp /home/root/temp/reMarkable-customizations/scripts/random-screens/random-screens.service /usr/lib/systemd/user/random-screens.service
cp /home/root/temp/reMarkable-customizations/scripts/random-screens/random-screens.timer /usr/lib/systemd/user/random-screens.timer
```

- Save original images

```bash
cp /usr/share/remarkable/poweroff.png /usr/share/remarkable/poweroff.original.png
cp /usr/share/remarkable/suspended.png /usr/share/remarkable/suspended.original.png
```

You can now delete your temp folder.

- Enable service and timer

```bash
systemctl enable /usr/lib/systemd/user/random-screens.timer
systemctl enable /usr/lib/systemd/user/random-screens.service
```

- Restart your reMarkable

- You should now see one of your custom suspend and poweroff image in place. To do some troubleshooting, you can use these commands:

```bash
$ systemctl list-timers
NEXT                         LEFT          LAST                         PASSED  UNIT                         ACTIVATES

### Installation script

WIP :)

## Changing the timer

You can change the frequency of the refresh by modifying the value `OnUnitActiveSec` inside the file `/usr/lib/systemd/user/random-screens.timer` and then restarting your reMarkable.
